= Installation of bookiemoney

There is currently not much installation to be done, just download the code and unpack it somewhere, either using one of the following two commands:

.Git clone the source code repository
----
git clone https://github.com/ericzolf/bookiemoney.git
git clone git@github.com:ericzolf/bookiemoney.git
----

or by downloading an archive of the repository, e.g. at
https://github.com/ericzolf/bookiemoney/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

You'll also need Python 3 (probably 3.9 or newer) and the following Python modules:

* PyYAML
* Babel

NOTE: they're available under Fedora as package `python3-pyyaml` and `python3-babel`.

You're then ready to use bookiemoney directly from the source code directory.
If you can call the following and get some help, you're probably good to go:

----
[bookiemoney]$ ./combine_bank_statements.py --help
----
